Materials have been developed and adapted by many contributors. It was started
from the Software Carpentry material on shell scripting, but underwent a
large-scale rewrite, reorganization, and narrowing by Hilmar Lapp to focus on
shell scripting for building executable data pipelines. The full history of this
rewrite is available at:

The first Data Carpentry workshop was run at NESCent on May 8-9, 2014 with the
development and instruction of lessons by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy
Teal and Ethan White and contributions from Deb Paul and Mike Smorul.
